        <![CDATA[
        <b>Floating Tools</b> provides quick access floating tools that you can use from anywhere on your phone.
        Each tool appears as a movable toggle on your screen, letting you perform actions instantly
        without switching apps. You can enable or disable any tool with a single tap, and the app
        clearly shows which permissions are needed for each feature.<br/><br/>
        Once activated, the toggles stay accessible across all apps, making tasks like calculations,
        notes, or screen actions faster and easier. You can stop individual tools by tapping their
        buttons or dragging them to the bottom of the screen, or close everything at once using the
        Stop button. The app is designed to be simple, efficient, and always within reach.]]>
